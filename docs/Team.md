  EE-Emerge is part of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Davis. Within a year, sophomores and juniors conceive, design, and build an interactive electronic system and present it at the UCD Picnic Day and the Bay Area Maker Faire. Texas Instruments sponsors EE-Emerge.
