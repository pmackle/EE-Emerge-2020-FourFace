FourFace is a project developed for EE-Emerge during the 2019/2020 academic year. FourFace is interactive memory game created by undergraduates from EE-Emerge a group within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Davis during the 2019/2020 academic year;. The premise of this game is to compete against three other people and imitate the given pattern. As each round starts, the pattern becomes increasingly difficult. Once a person fails to imitate the given pattern, they will be eliminated. Last person to survive the remaining rounds is crowned the winner. Some highlights worth mentioning are CapSense technology, custom PCB's and mechanical design, and user friendliness.
